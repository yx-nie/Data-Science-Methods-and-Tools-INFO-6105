6105 Assignment 4

1. Project Main Goal
   The objective of this project is to explore Naive Bayes classifier. 


2. Dataset
   I use the 20 newsgroups dataset (http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/ ). 
   The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. 
   Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (group by the same color), while others are highly unrelated.


3. Model
   Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with/without TF-IDF.


5. Conclusion
   My MNB classifier accuracy is pretty low, I have tried my best to rewrite the classifier function, but now I haven't find the reason why it's low.
   In my project, TF-IDF does not improve the prediction accuracy.
